Evelyn is an open-source large language model frontend that I created as an exercise to freshen up my skills in **Next**, **Tailwind** and UI design.  It is capable of connecting to real LLM backends, and currently has the ability to connect to Google Gemini using an API key. I am planning on expanding its abilities in the future.  Check my blog for a more detailed technical write up!
