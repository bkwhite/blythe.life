[Static Age Records](https://staticagenc.com) is an independent music venue in Asheville, NC.  I created a custom website for them using **Next**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind**.  The content of the site is managed in **Sanity**, and the site is hosted on **Vercel**.  The site features a design that reflects the aesthetic of the venue, and includes a calendar of events and information customers may need in regards to the venue.
