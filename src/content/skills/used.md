Just because I'm not in love with a technology doesn't mean I won't use it if that's the correct choice for the job!  Sometimes you need an API that goes beyond the scope of what **Next** is designed to do!  So maybe **Express** is the right choice.  Working with a lot of raw data?  Perhaps it's time for **Python**...
