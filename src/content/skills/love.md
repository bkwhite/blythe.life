I've been poking around the internet since I was a kid, so i've had ample time to develop some opinions on which tech I **love** and which tech I *can work with*. I will outline some of my favorites here, but this is by no means the exhaustive list of my personal tech stack.  Learning a new technology is something I always love to do.

**TypeScript**, **React** & **Next** have become my go-to's for building highly interactive web experiences.  When I'm building something lighter I grab for **Astro**. (Like this site for example!) Lately i've been doing some game dev and systems programming in my free time and have fallen in love with **Rust**.
