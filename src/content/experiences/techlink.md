At **TechLink**, I worked on a variety of projects for clients.  We worked together as a team to design and engineer applications from the ground up that met the needs we gathered from the clients.

We created web applications using **React** and **Vue** for the front-end. For the back-end, we used **Express** to create REST APIs and platform tools like Cognito from **AWS** to handle users. Additionally, we created mobile apps using **React-Native** or NativeScript (**Vue**).
