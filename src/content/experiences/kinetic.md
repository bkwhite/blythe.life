Kinetic Multisports is a triathlon production company with unique technical needs!  During my time working with them, I worked on a variety of projects:

- Developed an OpenCart web store to serve their budding e-commerce needs.
- Building a webcrawling suite (using **Node**) to scrape data from their old website after becoming independent from their previous parent company.
- Constructed a custom analytics dashboard using **D3** and **Python** to visualize customer data for marketing purposes.
- General consulting on their fast expanding **WordPress** website.
