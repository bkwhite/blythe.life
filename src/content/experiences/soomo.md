Collaboration with stakeholders, project managers and designers was crucial at **Soomo**. When working on new features I followed designs provided by the UX team and worked closely with them to ensure the final product met the collective vision.  I've also done some light work on the Rails backend when needed.

Most of the code I wrote at Soomo was **TypeScript** / **React**.  **Redux** and **Redux-Toolkit** were the go-to for state management and client-side networking.  We used UI frameworks like **Chakra** and **MUI** for rapid UI development.  I also wrote automated test suites in **Cypress** and **Playwright**.

My biggest accomplishments during my time at Soomo were:
- Re-engineering the content rendering system to go from server-side rendered **Rails** templates to a fully client-side **React** renderer.
- Implemented the system that allows instructors to preview content and request to sign-up to use the platform.
- Migrated the marketing site from **Gatsby** to **Next**.

**\*** This position was initially full-stack focused, so I wasn't strictly focused on the front-end in the beginning.  This shift happened overtime based on a mixture of the needs of the projects I was working on and my personal tastes!
