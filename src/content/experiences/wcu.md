My course work at Western was mainly **Java** based, but also included some **Python**.  I received a solid foundation in computer science principles, like algorithms and data structures.

During my time at University, I studied web development in my own time.  Picking up some freelance work and learning so much about practical software development.

I chose to do my senior capstone in **React** because I sensed it was the future of web development.
