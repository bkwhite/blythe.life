Thank you for getting this far! This site was hand crafted using **[Astro](https://astro.build)** & **Markdown**. All the **CSS** was written from scratch ðŸ˜Ž. Since this site is one page, bringing in something like **React** or **Vue** felt a bit overkill.

I started the design of this site on a piece of paper, then hammered out a more high fidelity mockup using **Figma**. From there I fine tuned the design in the way I was most comfortable, **which is coding**!

I have made the source code for this site available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/blythe-lifecraft/blythe.life).
